Ursula K. Le Guin, the feminist writer, has a story called "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas". Her tale is about an imaginary, prosperous city where the happiness and well-being of all its citizens depend on the suffering and torment of a single child locked away in a dark basement. When the people of Omelas learn of this reality, they respond in two different ways: some choose to leave the city, while others accept the situation and continue their carefree lives.<br>
<br>
But Omelas is not merely a fictional city. Today, we can find its parallels in many corners of our daily lives. A striking example is the extraction of cobalt in Congo, a vital material for producing the batteries that power nearly all of our electronic devices: cars, mobile phones, and even the very laptop I am using to write these words. We, the users of these devices, are like the carefree citizens of Omelas, while the Congolese workers are that child imprisoned underground.<br>
<br>
And faced with this reality, what do we do? I have no answer to that question.
