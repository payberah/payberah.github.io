In the neoliberal era, profit and productivity have become the main priorities, with tech-driven approaches pushing everything to be faster, more efficient, and more accurate. Along the way, we have started to view these qualities not just as measures for machines and systems but as markers of human progress. But aren't we more than that? Maybe it's time to pause and reflect on what truly defines progress for humanity. Perhaps it's not about doing more, faster, and more efficiently, but about being kinder, more responsible, and more loving, the values that Erich Fromm beautifully explored in The Art of Loving. Maybe it's time we let them guide us once again.
