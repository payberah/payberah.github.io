Last year, a friend/colleague asked me to design & deliver a PhD course. It wasn't an easy task, but I accepted the challenge. Sadly he passed away recently, and today when I gave the last lecture I was thinking of him. I hope he is happy with the result: <a href="https://fid3024.github.io/">https://fid3024.github.io</a>
