<p align="justify">
I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Simon Fraser University's Engineering Science (ENSC) department, deeply passionate about research in deep learning and computer vision. Currently, I am dedicated to exploring the intersections of Information Theory and Deep Learning, with a specific focus on developing learned image compression for machines. I boast extensive experience in Python programming, excelling in both PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks, and have been working with Python and deep models since 2016.<br>
</p>
<br>My research interests include:
