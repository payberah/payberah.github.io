I am a machine learning scientist at the <a href="http://www.georgeinstitute.org.uk/">Geroge Institute</a> in <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>.
I am working on solving high-impact healthcare problems, with the application of machine learning algorithms to large multi-model biomedical datasets. Prior to that, I was a senior researcher at the <a href="http://www.sics.se">Swedish Institute of Computer Science (SICS)</a>. My focus at SICS was on mining massive datasets and data intensive computing platforms (mainly Spark). I got my PhD from <a href="http://www.kth.se/eng">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> in Sweden in June 2013. During my PhD studies, I worked on distributed algorithms, Peer-to-Peer content distribution networks, gossip-based algorithms and large scale publish/subscribe systems.<br><br>My research interests include:
