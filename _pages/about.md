I'm an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the Division of <a href="https://www.kth.se/scs">Software and Computer Systems (SCS)</a> at <a href="https://www.kth.se">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> 
in Sweden. I earned my PhD from KTH in 2013, specializing in distributed systems. Following my doctoral studies, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the 
<a href="https://www.ri.se/en">Research Institute of Sweden (RISE)</a>, focusing on data-intensive computing platforms. During my time as a postdoc at RISE, I also had the privilege of working as a guest 
lecturer at <a href="https://ce.aut.ac.ir/">Amirkabir University of Tehran (AUT)</a> from 2013 until 2015. In 2017, I embarked on a role as a machine learning scientist at 
<a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford University</a>, where I remained until 2018, and subsequently, I returned to KTH as an Assistant Professor.<br>

My current research revolves around the domains of scalable machine learning and deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language models. Furthermore, I am engaged as the specialization 
representative of SCS in the ICT Doctoral program council and serve as a member of the workgroup for the software technology Master programs within the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer 
Science (EECS).<br>

My primary focus and passion lies in enhancing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_consciousness">critical consciousness</a> within the realms of computing education and research. 
Computing lacks neutrality, and some of the harm caused by computing systems is rooted in pre-existing structures of societal oppression. Critical consciousness equips computer science researchers to 
identify and analyze these societal inequalities and oppressive systems and empowers them to act against these injustices. I advocate for integrating justice and equity as fundamental values in computer 
science research and educational endeavors, ensuring that our work serves the good of all individuals.
